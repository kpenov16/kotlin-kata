###Step 1 Create a String calculator with a method int Add(string numbers)
1. a. The method can take 0, 1, or 2 numbers and will return their sum.

2. b. An empty string will return 0.

3. c. Example inputs: “”, “1”, or “1,2”

4. d. Start with the simplest test case of an empty string. Then 1 number. Then 2 numbers.

5. e. Remember to solve things as simply as possible, forcing yourself to write tests for things you
didn’t think about.

6. f. Remember to refactor after each passing test
